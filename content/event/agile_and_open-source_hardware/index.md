summary: ''

abstract: 'Agile and open-source hardware design is considered to be one of the most promising ways to
lower the design cost of chip design. In this Talk, I will introduce two projects: 1) XiangShan is an
open-source high-performance RISC-V processor project started in June 2020. The first generation of
XiangShan was taped-out at a frequency of 1.3GHz on 28-nm CMOS process in July 2021, which
achieved a score of 7/GHz on SPECCPU 2006. The second generation of XiangShan targets 2GHz on
14-nm CMOS process and will be taped-out recently, achieving a score of 10/GHz on SPECCPU
2006. XiangShan is developed in Chisel, using many new open-source agile tools. 2) The One
Student One Chip (OSOC) Initiative was launched in 2019, aiming to instruct undergraduates to build
real chips. Five undergraduates participated in the OSOC Initiative and completed a 64-bit RISC-V
processor SoC, which was manufactured by SIMC 110nm technology and can successfully run Linux
at 200MHz. By now, more than 1800 students of 200 universities applied to participate in the OSOC
Initiative.'
